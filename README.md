# Home_SalesHome Sales Data Analysis with PySpark

This project involves using PySpark and SparkSQL to analyze home sales data. The dataset contains information about home sales, including prices, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, year built, square footage, and view ratings. The goal is to answer specific questions and perform various operations on the data.

## Instructions

The Jupyter Notebook, "Home_Sales.ipynb," contains detailed instructions and code for the following tasks:

1. Creating a Spark DataFrame from the dataset.
2. Creating a temporary table.
3. Answering specific questions using SparkSQL.
4. Caching and uncaching the temporary table.
5. Partitioning the data and working with Parquet files.

## Results

The project answers several questions about home sales data, calculates average prices, and measures query runtimes. It also demonstrates caching and uncaching of temporary tables, as well as working with partitioned Parquet data.
